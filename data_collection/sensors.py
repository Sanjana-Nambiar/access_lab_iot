# this file should define 2 things
# sensors: list with ALL the sensors of all types
#           Any beseecher sensor connected to the station must be appended to
#           this list
# gps: unlike the sensors, the gps will be a unique variable with the gps beseecher.
#
# When initializing sensors, ALWAYS use a try-except block in case the RPi 
# fails to start the sensors at boot. The error beseecher class will store any
# error information that comes up and will allow data-collection to report on 
# the error.
